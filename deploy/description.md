### <b>Welcome!</b>
ADXplorer is an interactive tool to perform exploratory analysis on an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) phospho-proteomics\\(^1\\) and proteomics\\(^2\\) datasets. We developed this application to help understand the temporal and sex-linked variations of AD with a particular focus on biomarker discovery and candidate target identification.

ADXplorer features label-free proteome\\(^1\\) and phosphoproteome measurements of mouse hippocampus tissue with variables of time (3, 6, and 9 months), sex, and genetic background (5XFAD versus wild type). These time points are associated with well-defined AD phenotypes: Aβ42 plaque deposition, memory deficits, and neuronal loss, allowing correlation of proteome-based molecular signatures with the mouse model stages.
