# AD-Xplorer: Exploring Alzheimer's Disease Phospho-Proteome
This repository contains the materials used to create AD-Xplorer, an online interactive tool featured in our research paper titled *'Exploring Temporal and Sex-Linked Dysregulation in Alzheimer's Disease Phospho-Proteome'*. This tool allows researchers to investigate changes in phosphorylation, protein expression, inferred kinase activities, and pathway enrichment, providing a user-friendly platform for in-depth exploration and interpretation of our AD-related proteomics datasets.

This tool is developed with the interactive data browser feature of [RokaiXplorer](https://rokai.io/explorer) and it is accessible at: [https://yilmazs.shinyapps.io/ADXplorer](https://yilmazs.shinyapps.io/ADXplorer). For more information, check out the [RokaiXplorer Github repository](https://github.com/serhan-yilmaz/RokaiXplorer).
